## Welcome to Web Dev Quest!

The purpose of this site is to document my journey while I learn to become a web developer. My hope is that readers can use my writings as a guide of what to do and what not to do along the way. 
I will also post tutorials on topics that I found difficult as I am sure I am not the only.
