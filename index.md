## Welcome to Web Dev Quest!

Hello and welcome to Web Dev Quest! My name is JR. I am a husband, father and USMC veteran 
on a quest of obtaining the knowledge and skills required to become a web developer. The purpose 
of this website is to serve as a guide to all who seek to reaching the same goal.
           
I will do my best to document my journey in as much detail as possible, in hopes to serve as a guide 
for developers like me who are trying to learn how to code on their own. In addition I will provide links 
to any documentation and tutorials that have aided me in my journey.

I will try my best to provide as much free material as possible. However, some of the resources that I've used do require 
payment. That being said, I will do what I can to find any free options that server as equal 
alternatives. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to DM me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/JR_Noble1">@JR_Noble1</a>. 
Thank you for visiting my blog and I hope that you chose to join me on this quest of becoming a <strong>Web Developer!</strong>
